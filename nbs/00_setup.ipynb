    "\n",
    "In `normal` and `high frequency` modes, a synchronisation pulse is sent on every trigger pulse, while in `burst` mode a synchronisation pulse is sent only on the first pulse of each burst. This allows recording to be synchronised to the start of each burst, rather than activating the recording system on every pulse within a burst.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commercial EMG systems use a falling-edge signal to trigger recording. The synchronisation signal is therefore held at 5V. When sending a synchronisation pulse, the output is pulled down to 0V for 25$\\mu$s. This will trigger recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that EMG systems vary in the format and pinout of their trigger connectors. This may therefore require a custom cable, e.g. a BNC to 9-pin sub-D connector cable, to connect the synchronisation signal output to the correct input pin on the target recording system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of the synchronisation output for each stimulation type are shown in the [`triggering`](./triggering.html) section."
